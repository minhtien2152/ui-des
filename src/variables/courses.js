    desciption: `Hi! Welcome to The Business Intelligence Analyst Course, the only course you need to become a BI Analyst. 

    We are proud to present you this one-of-a-kind opportunity. There are several online courses teaching some of the skills related to the BI Analyst profession. The truth of the matter is that none of them completely prepare you.
    
    Our program is different than the rest of the materials available online.  
    
    It is truly comprehensive. The Business Intelligence Analyst Course comprises of several modules:   
    
    Introduction to Data and Data Science   
    
    Statistics and Excel  
    
    Database theory  
    
    SQL  
    
    Tableau  
    
    SQL + Tableau  
    
    These are the precise technical skills recruiters are looking for when hiring BI Analysts. And today, you have the chance of acquiring an invaluable advantage to get ahead of other candidates. This course will be the secret to your success. And your success is our success, so let’s make it happen!  
    
    Here are some more details of what you get with The Business Intelligence Analyst Course:   
    
    Introduction to Data and Data Science – Make sense of terms like business intelligence, traditional and big data, traditional statistical methods, machine learning, predictive analytics, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and many more;   
    
    Statistics and Excel – Understand statistical testing and build a solid foundation. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this part of the course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities;  
    
    Database theory – Before you start using SQL, it is highly beneficial to learn about the underlying database theory and acquire an understanding of why databases are created and how they can help us manage data   
    
    SQL - when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business   
    
    Tableau – one of the most powerful and intuitive data visualization tools available out there. Almost all large companies use such tools to enhance their BI capabilities. Tableau is the #1 best-in-class solution that helps you create powerful charts and dashboards  
    
    Learning a programming language is meaningless without putting it to use. That’s why we integrate SQL and Tableau, and perform several real-life Business Intelligence tasks   
    
    Sounds amazing, right?   
    
    Our courses are unique because our team works hard to:   
    
    Pre-script the entire content    
    
    Work with real-life examples  
    
    Provide easy to understand and complete explanations  
    
    Create beautiful and engaging animations  
    
    Prepare exercises, course notes, quizzes, and other materials that will enhance your course taking experience  
    
    Be there for you and provide support whenever necessary  
    
    We love teaching and we are really excited about this journey. It will get your foot in the door of an exciting and rising profession. Don’t hesitate and subscribe today. The only regret you will have is that you didn’t find this course sooner!`,

    name: "Neuroplasticity: How To Rewire Your Brain",
    desciption: `This course is N°1 in its category, here on Udemy. It used to be unique. It was the first of its kind. It has been copied many times since, on this platform and elsewhere. 

    But this is the real deal. My expertise is in Brain Science. This is what I do for a living: sharing my passion for the brain with you. And with this course, you're in for a treat...
    
    This course was selected as ‘one of the coolest online courses’ by 'mentalfloss' (a website with 15 million visitors in the USA)
    
    What it will do, is let you experience neuroplasticity for yourself, from a whole set of exercises, over changing habits and even altering memories.
    
    
    
    Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.
    
    Not that long ago, scientists believed the brain could only create new connections during childhood and once we reached adulthood, we would basically be stuck with whatever got wired up there. You know, the good old ‘you can’t learn an old dog new tricks’.
    
    Well, turns out you can. And it’s all about Neuroplasticity
    
    Our brain continues to create new neurons throughout our life and the ability to reorganize our wiring is called neuroplasticity. And this has tremendous consequences. It means that, whoever we are, whatever we’ve become, it is never too late to change. We can learn new skills, we can change old habits and create new ones. We can learn, we can grow, we can improve our lives.
    
    Still, even though we all have this capacity, most of us stay stuck in a seamless dead-end street. Habits are hard to break. Change requires too much effort. It’s too painful. And we end up settling for not even second best, but rather some average ranking down there. Our life as it could be remains a distant dream, because we gave up.
    
    So with this course, I want to change that. I want to harness the power of neuroplasticity and give people the opportunity to take life back into their own hands. This course has a hands on approach. It's about how you can take action to use this Neuroplasticity to your advantage. How to concretely take action in your own life. More than anything else, this course is about empowerment. About how to reconnect with your dream life and start making that change.
    
    What you'll find in the course:
    
    This little gem will bring you cutting edge brain research, from enriched environments to implanting memories, over the anatomy of habits. It's packed with concrete tools, so you can apply this immediately in your own life: 
    
    Over 30 exercises to stimulate brain activity, 
    
    A detailed blueprint to form new habits or change existing ones
    
    A full chapter on how to overcome procrastination
    
    A step by step approach to neutralize painful memories
    
    (Disclaimer: This course will not make you a superhuman, nor will it be helpful in treating brain injuries. I just wanted to make that clear)`,

    requirements: [
      "A keen interest in how our brain works is the only real prerequisite for this course",

  Whether you’re a complete beginner, or intermediate at character drawing, you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew. Seriously. Inspired by masters and built on the theory of giants, Character Drawing Academy is one of, if not the most comprehensive character drawing course out there. I’m so convinced of this, I’ll give you a no-questions asked refund if you’re not satisfied.
  
  Clear, Easy to Understand Lessons

  Assignments that are Rewarding
  
  Bridging the gap between theory and practice, each module’s assignments have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each assignment to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately. Art is about doing, so let’s get started- let’s draw something awesome!
  
  What's Your Style?

  What are Students Saying about the Course?
  
  "Probably the best art course I've ever taken -- online or in college. Wonderfully presented, it helped me correct mistakes I'd been making that were really holding my artwork back. I've seen phenomenal progress after 30 days practice of the course material. Highly recommended." 
  
  Dan Rahmel
  
  "Just a perfect 5 stars rating. It's really complete and filled with advice, theories and concrete examples. As he said, it's probably the last character drawing course you'll take. It's all I wanted. Thank you so much Scott Harris!" 
  
  Mario
  
  "Amazing course. I haven't even started drawing yet because I'm in awe of how simple the instructor makes even the most complicated techniques look. At last, drawing like a pro is within my grasp! I also like the fact that the instructor allows me to just watch the first time through without worrying about drawing until I'm familiar with the concepts. My next time through the course, I'll be prepared and more confident than ever to begin drawing. Even so, I've already used some of the concepts in this course for a sketch here and there when I feel inspired to draw, and I can tell worlds of difference between my former drawings and newer ones. Laid back instructor, but very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course."
